# Formula-Student-AI-QCar-Autonomous-Navigation
AI-driven autonomous navigation system developed for Formula Student AI using Quanser QCar and QLabs. The project implements vision-based cone detection, EKF-based sensor fusion, and real-time control algorithms to enable autonomous lap navigation, path tracking, and performance evaluation in a Formula Student–style racing environment.
